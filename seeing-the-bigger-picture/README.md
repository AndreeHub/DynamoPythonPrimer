# 2 Seeing The Bigger Picture ðŸ”­

#### Setting the Scene

Programming rarely takes place in a bubble. There's a wealth of context informing the code you're writing, for instance: 

* Are you writing something for a desktop OS \(Windows, Unix\), for mobile or something for the web?
* Are you writing a quick, throwaway script or a sophisticated product that will need to be maintained for many years to come?
* Will you be relying on external libraries for handling certain tasks?

This chapter is about unfolding the context of writing Python scripts in Dynamo. Knowing this environment will help you unlock a vast array of powerful tools already at your disposal.
