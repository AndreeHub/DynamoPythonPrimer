# 4.15 Feedback: TaskDialogs

Useful to provide a level of feedback to a user. Something obvious that states whether the script ran successfully or encountered any errors.

TaskDialog is Revit's native class for this. Can be used for delivering simple messages or customised to make user interaction richer. Level of customisation is limited to what's available via the UI.
